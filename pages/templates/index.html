          The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian.

        <h3>Found a Bug or Want to Suggest a Feature?</h3>
        
        <p>We work really hard to make finding Unicorns as easy as finding a needle in a haystack, but sometimes we miss things. Finding a bug in the software can be a real pain in the app.</p>
        
        <p>If you find a problem with the app, the chances are others will have the same problem. If you report the bug others can let us know they to have that same issue.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, maybe you wish there was something we could add to the app to improve it. If this is the case then you can suggest a feature, and others can let us know they want to see that feature too.</p>
        
        <p>Just click that big button below and your wish is our command</p>
